<h2>About me...</h2>

<p>My name is Ann Groll, I am 23 years of age. I live with my boyfriend of 6 years in 
Saukville, Wisconsin. I am attending Full Sail University to get my Bachelors degree in 
Science for web design. I don't have any children right now, but I do have a 6 year old
cat who is like my baby to me.</p>

<h3>Family life</h3>
<p>I am the youngest out of 5 children, <strong>I have 10 nieces and nephews.</strong>
To be quite honest, my family is not very close knit like some families. We fight and 
argue, we might not see each other a lot but in the end we are family and need to love 
one another. My second oldest niece just got married and is having a baby thats due in 
November. So that makes me a great-aunt as well! <strong>How exciting!</strong></p>

<p>I hope everyone has a fantastic day!</p>
